## Abstract
Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) has proven effective as
a framework for supporting a variety of safety, entertainment,
and commercial applications. This is realized by applying the
principles of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) to facilitate connectivity
among vehicles and between vehicles and roadside units (RSUs).
Congestion management is essential for IoV-based vehicular
networks safety, and it represents a significant concern for the
economic, environmental, and industrial sectors. This is due
to its impact on several pressing problems, such as improving
the efficiency of transportation systems and providing reliable
communication among vehicles for the timely delivery of safety-
critical packets. This paper proposes a novel proactive framework
for congestion management for IoV-based vehicular networks.
We generate congestion scenarios using SUMO and NS3 and
packet congestion is stored in a dataset, from which we learn
to predict the congestion effectively using LSTM. We present
the detailed implementation and simulations for the proposed
pipeline and the generated packet congestion dataset. The results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework for forecasting
congestion and clustering/prioritizing packets with unsupervised
machine learning.
